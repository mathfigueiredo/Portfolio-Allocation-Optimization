# Portfolio-Allocation-Optimization

Using Monte Carlo Simulation to get the best portfolio allocation

---------
This is going to be the output of this project:
- Each point in this chart correspond to a different allocation. I estimated 12 thousands different allocations with Monte Carlo Simulation to get this chart.
- Given the accepted volatility of an investor, we can recommend the best allocation.
- The red dashed line is the Efficient Frontier: the allocation with maximum return for each volatility.
